# Emergence in Spiking Neural Networks

## Emergence of functional connectivity networks on a brain-inspired spiking neural network model

To understand the true nature of neural changes underlying brain function requires an integrated systems-level approach. Great effort has gone in to the investigation of functional connectivity networks (FCNs) which represent brain regions that correlate in activation during resting-state or task. Such investigations have unveiled the scale-free, small-world, modular and rich-club organization of brain function.

What if the FCNs we see in neuroimaging studies with fMRI can be derived from simulated spiking neuronal networks (SNNs)? These SNNs could learn patterns of association presented in the simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data through principals of Hebbian learning. The connections formed are spatially restricted to projections of axonal bundles observed in the MRI technique diffusion weighted imaging.

Traditionally, brain networks are investigated by graph representation derived from the correlation between regionally-averaged time courses. In contrast, the networks of function that emerge in such an SNN model are a product of Hebbian learning and are restricted by biological plausibility.

This biologically-restricted emergence of functional connectivity could allow for in-silico experiments of the causal mechanisms by which such networks are disrupted in neurological disorders.
